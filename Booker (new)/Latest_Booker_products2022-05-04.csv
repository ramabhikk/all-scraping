Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum seeks its own path in life… Like the free-spirited man who inspired the drink - the old school tattooist, Norman ‘Sailor Jerry' Collins.

After one sip you'll see why Sailor Jerry is unique. Vanilla hits your nose first and after a couple of sniffs, and you'll notice dry buttery toffee and a touch of cinnamon. Taste-wise, rich vanilla tones with warm hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, just about sums up the flavours. We're extremely proud of the finish - long and dry with a balance of subdued sweetness and a hint of toasted toffee. Are you a heat worshipper? If you can't get enough of the energising kick and warmth of ginger, there are many creative, tasty gingersome ways that you can add more heat and punch to Sailor Jerry.

Meanwhile our maltmen turn the barley up to four times a day, seven days a week. The Distillery has been owned and managed by the same independent family company for five generations. To produce The Balvenie DoubleWood 12 Year Old, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads to mellow the maturing spirit and Impart warming layers of vanilla spiciness. He then moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months to increase complexity, bringing fruity, honeyed depths to the resulting Single Malt. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called “tuns” for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies to “marry”.

And yet it is precisely this eccentricity that defines the enigmatic character of Montgomery Collins, from whom our Schwarzwald Dry Gin originates. A good third of the 47 botanicals for this special gin come from the Black Forest and are definitely not what you would call typical gin flavorings! These handpicked ingredients, prepared in extremely soft spring water from our own Black Forest source, give the unrivaled complexity and quality to MONKEY 47, whose piece de resistance is the use of local cranberries as some sort of ""secret weapon"" typical to the Black Forest. Whether with tonic, as a sling, martini, or gimlet, the unique and complex taste of Monkey 47 is an ideal basis for both classics and more eccentric cocktails.

The golden honeyed liquid is perfect enjoyed on its own, with or without ice and has a delicious lingering warmth.

Mojitos are long and refreshing highball drinks and one of the most popular cocktails. Why not try a Scottish Mojito, simply mix 50ml Drambuie, half a squeezed lemon with fresh mint, top up with lots of ice and pour over soda or sparkling water.

With a unique freshness from the same Highland spring water we've used since 1887, its distinctive fruitiness comes from the high cut point William Grant always insisted upon. Carefully matured in the finest American oak and European oak sherry casks for at least 12 years, it is mellowed in oak marrying tuns to create its sweet and subtle oak flavours. Creamy with a long, smooth and mellow finish, our 12 Year Old is the perfect example of Glenfiddich's unique Speyside style and is widely proclaimed the best dram in the valley. For 20 years William Grant nurtured a dream to make the ‘best dram in the valley'. With the help of his family, he finally achieved that vision. In the summer of 1886, with his seven sons and two daughters by his side, William set out to fulfil a lifelong ambition. Together they began building his Distillery by hand, stone by stone. After a single year of work it was ready and William named it Glenfiddich, Gaelic for Valley of the Deer. William's passion, determination and pioneering spirit continues to guide us today. Glenfiddich is one of the few single malt distilleries to remain entirely family owned and is now the World's Most Awarded Single Malt Scotch Whisky, a true reflection of our founder's innovative nature, passed down through the generations.Alcohol By Volume: 40Units: 28Tasting Notes: Nose: Distinctively fresh and fruity with a hint of pear.

Creamy with a long, smooth and mellow finish, our 12 Year Old is the perfect example of Glenfiddich's unique Speyside style and is widely proclaimed the best dram in the valley.

In the summer of 1886, with his seven sons and two daughters by his side, William set out to fulfil a lifelong ambition. Together they began building his Distillery by hand, stone by stone. After a single year of work it was ready and William named it Glenfiddich, Gaelic for Valley of the Deer. William's passion, determination and pioneering spirit continues to guide us today.

5014379014457	,266942,Corona Lager Beer Bottle 620ml,"BeerType: Sunshine lager ABV: 4.5% Overall impression: Golden lager, slightly fruity, with a crisp but refreshing bitterness Born in Mexico and brought up on the beach, Corona is lighter than traditional beers, with a crisp and refreshing taste. The aroma is fruity-honey with a touch of malt and the flavour is crisp and well-balanced between hops and malt, toward the malt side. Whatever the time of year, Corona is best served ice cold and with a wedge of lime, that both complements and intensifies the flavor, with the refreshing citrus notes. Every sip of Corona, conjures images of golden sands and pale blue skies, transporting you to instant relaxation and disconnection. Corona's superior taste profile is due to the fact that our brewers take great care to use only the best ingredients available, made with the finest quality blend of filtered water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. The unmistakable colour, the one-of-a-kind taste, the unparalleled flavor of relaxation makes it 'la cerveza mas fina', made for gathering with friends. Find us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and our own channels: www.coronaextra.co.uk www.tapintoyourbeer.com+B2 FOOD PAIRING RECOMMENDATION Subtle flavours and low alcohol intensity means Corona can be overpowered. However, it's fragrant nature and citrus notes, when combined with lime, also make it a great partner for several cuisines: in particular Thai, Chinese and Mexican. The sweetness from the malts is also at the right level to reduce medium heat that can often be found in dishes from these areas. HOME-RUN PAIRING: NACHOS Corn Nachos will have flavor matches with the corn used as part of the grain bill for Corona. The carbonation will help cut through any rich and fatty toppings such as avocado, sour cream or cheese, whilst the malt sweetness will offset any moderate heat from jalapenos or other varieties of chillis. Finally the lime added to the corona will add a citrus burst to the nachos as well helping further accentuate the flavors on your palate.2.8 UK Units per bottle Please Drink Responsibly The UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week. drinkaware.co.uk Please Recycle Brewed Under Licence from Cerveceria Modelo, S.

Only through using expertly balanced malted barley, the finest European Saaz hops, and classic brewing methods can our Stella Artois brewmasters create such a superior golden elixir that simply must be savoured. And the best way to do so? The Belgian way, of course: perfectly poured, sipped from a Chalice, and enjoyed in the company of friends with a nibble of something delicious. Santé! Serving Best served chilled in our iconic Chalice. A medium hop intensity, along with some residual sweetness from its malts makes Stella Artois is a versatile beer when pairing with food. Food Pairing Stella Artois pairs well with salmon, tuna and marbled meat. Its bitterness offers a pleasing contrast with sweet reductions and sauces and its carbonation means it pairs well with rich and fried foods, as long as their intensity is not too high. Home-Run Pairing Beer Battered Fish and Chips There are several flavor bridges and complementary elements between Stella Artois and fish and chips. Firstly Stella Artois can actually be used in the cooking stage, with Stella Artois' carbonation adding a lovely lightness to the batter and also a slight cracker and nutty flavours to the dish. The beer's intensity is also just at the right level to stand up against the fried fish without stealing the show or being overwhelmed, whilst the carbonation helps cleanse the palate. The slight floral notes from the hops and residual sweetness from the malts will play nicely alongside the acidity of a squeeze of lemon or a dash of vinegar which often accompanies the fish. Finally, the gentle hop bitterness will offset any sweetness from any complementary mushy peas on the side.10 x 2.0 UK Units per can Please Drink Responsibly The UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week. drinkaware.co.uk for the facts Please RecycleAlcohol By Volume: 4.6Tasting Notes: With a flavourful taste and a clean finish, Stella Artois is meant to be savouredServing Suggestion: Best served chilled in our iconic Chalice.

Learn more on www.Budlightbeer.co.uk or www.tapintoyourbeer.com Food Pairing Recommendation Due to Bud Light's crisp and relatively neutral taste, Bud Light should only be paired with low intensity foods or otherwise risks being lost or overpowered. Think salads and grilled white fish or chicken. Despite this, its refreshing nature and high carbonation does mean it can work with some rich and fatty foods as well. Home-Run Pairing: Chicken Ceasar Salad Bud Light's low intensity means it won't overpower salad leaves or grilled chicken and will allow you to enjoy every bite. However, its carbonation will help cut through the richness or the dressing and cleanse the palate after each mouthful.

Golden in color, Beck's is a classic German-style pilsner with a robust, distinctive full-bodied taste, a fresh “hoppy” bouquet, distinct bitterness and a rich, full head. Being at the forefront of innovative thinking, Beck's is well known for supporting up and coming talents within art, design, fashion and music. To find out more visit www.becks.com Learn more on www.tapintoyourbeer.com Food Pairing: Beck's low alcohol intensity means it shouldn't be paired with foods high in richness. We recommend pairing with Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisines. The malt sweetness and bitterness from the hops are at the right level to play sandbox to medium heat food. Whilst the crisp hoppiness can also lift spicing and starches allowing all flavours to shine through. Home-Run Pairing: Salmon Sushi Moist rice has a slight nutty texture and Beck's cracker malt flavour helps enhance this. The beer also has the right level of malt sweetness and bitterness to match the heat from wasabi. The bitterness helps balance fat and umami from salmon, meaning you'll get a fuller taste from the salmon, with the carbonation cleansing the palate after each bite.6 x 1.1 UK Units per bottle Please Drink Responsibly The UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week. drinkaware.co.uk for the facts Please RecycleAlcohol By Volume: 4", £13.99, 4 x 6x275ml , 20%,No,N/A

The aroma is fruity-honey with a touch of malt and the flavour is crisp and well-balanced between hops and malt, toward the malt side. Whatever the time of year, Corona is best served ice cold and with a wedge of lime, that both complements and intensifies the flavor, with the refreshing citrus notes. Every sip of Corona, conjures images of golden sands and pale blue skies, transporting you to instant relaxation and disconnection. Corona's superior taste profile is due to the fact that our brewers take great care to use only the best ingredients available, made with the finest quality blend of filtered water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. The unmistakable colour, the one-of-a-kind taste, the unparalleled flavor of relaxation makes it 'la cerveza mas fina', made for gathering with friends. FOOD PAIRING RECOMMENDATION Subtle flavours and low alcohol intensity means Corona can be overpowered. However, it's fragrant nature and citrus notes, when combined with lime, also make it a great partner for several cuisines: in particular Thai, Chinese and Mexican. The sweetness from the malts is also at the right level to reduce medium heat that can often be found in dishes from these areas. HOME-RUN PAIRING: NACHOS Corn Nachos will have flavor matches with the corn used as part of the grain bill for Corona. The carbonation will help cut through any rich and fatty toppings such as avocado, sour cream or cheese, whilst the malt sweetness will offset any moderate heat from jalapenos or other varieties of chillis. Finally the lime added to the corona will add a citrus burst to the nachos as well helping further accentuate the flavors on your palate.Beer carbonated prior to bottling Brewed Under Licence from Cerveceria Modelo, S.

We know of no brand produced by any other brewer which costs so much to brew and age.

Known as ""The King of Beers,"" Budweiser was first introduced by Adolphus Busch in 1876 and it's still brewed with the same high standards today.

The aroma is fruity-honey with a touch of malt and the flavour is crisp and well-balanced between hops and malt, toward the malt side. Whatever the time of year, Corona is best served ice cold and with a wedge of lime, that both complements and intensifies the flavor, with the refreshing citrus notes. Every sip of Corona, conjures images of golden sands and pale blue skies, transporting you to instant relaxation and disconnection. Corona's superior taste profile is due to the fact that our brewers take great care to use only the best ingredients available, made with the finest quality blend of filtered water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. The unmistakable colour, the one-of-a-kind taste, the unparalleled flavor of relaxation makes it 'la cerveza mas fina', made for gathering with friends. FOOD PAIRING RECOMMENDATION Subtle flavours and low alcohol intensity means Corona can be overpowered. However, it's fragrant nature and citrus notes, when combined with lime, also make it a great partner for several cuisines: in particular Thai, Chinese and Mexican. The sweetness from the malts is also at the right level to reduce medium heat that can often be found in dishes from these areas. HOME-RUN PAIRING: NACHOS Corn Nachos will have flavor matches with the corn used as part of the grain bill for Corona. The carbonation will help cut through any rich and fatty toppings such as avocado, sour cream or cheese, whilst the malt sweetness will offset any moderate heat from jalapenos or other varieties of chillis. Finally the lime added to the corona will add a citrus burst to the nachos as well helping further accentuate the flavors on your palate.Beer carbonated prior to bottling.

Golden in color, Beck's is a classic German-style pilsner with a robust, distinctive full-bodied taste, a fresh “hoppy” bouquet, distinct bitterness and a rich, full head. Food Pairing: Beck's low alcohol intensity means it shouldn't be paired with foods high in richness. We recommend pairing with Chinese, Japanese and Thai cuisines. The malt sweetness and bitterness from the hops are at the right level to play sandbox to medium heat food. Whilst the crisp hoppiness can also lift spicing and starches allowing all flavours to shine through. Home-Run Pairing: Salmon Sushi Moist rice has a slight nutty texture and Beck's cracker malt flavour helps enhance this. The beer also has the right level of malt sweetness and bitterness to match the heat from wasabi. The bitterness helps balance fat and umami from salmon, meaning you'll get a fuller taste from the salmon, with the carbonation cleansing the palate after each bite.2.6 UK Units per bottle Please Drink Responsibly The UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week. drinkaware.co.uk Please RecycleAlcohol By Volume: 4Units: 2.6", £16.79, 12 x 660ml , 20%,Yes,SAVE £2.00

With ¼ moisturising cream, it goes beyond cleansing, nourishing as it washes away the day. That’s because Dove isn’t just a bar soap, it’s a beauty bar. While ordinary soaps can strip skin of essential nutrients, Dove Beauty Bar has mild cleansers to care for skin as it cleans, which makes it suitable for sensitive skin. Combining a gentle, sulphate-SLES-?free formula with ¼ moisturising cream, this mild bar leaves your face and body feeling soft, smooth, and more radiant than ordinary soap does. Mild cleansers help your skin retain its natural moisture rather than strip it away. Dove Original Beauty Bar helps to replenish nutrients that are lost during the cleansing process. Where a regular soap might leave your skin feeling dry, tight and irritated, Dove leaves it softer, smoother, and healthier-looking before you’ve even stepped out of the shower. For best results: Lather up your Dove Original Beauty Bar and massage the smooth, creamy lather over your face and body before rinsing thoroughly. For soft, smooth hands, you can also enjoy regular hand-washing throughout the day with your Dove bar. Dove believes no young person should be held back from reaching their full potential. Since 2004, Dove has been building self-esteem and confidence in young people – and by 2030, they’ll have helped ¼ billion young people through their educational programmes and resources.", £23.99, 48 x 100g , 20%,No,N/A

In 1938 at the their Fulton factory in New York, USA, NESTLÉ® chocolatiers experimented with their already popular Nestlé Milk Chocolate bar by adding crisped rice and invented what we now know as the Nestlé CRUNCH® bar.

Today, NESTLÉ® CRUNCH® is sold in over 40 countries worldwide and is known due to its distrinctive vibrant blue wrapper and striking red font. Each CRUNCH® bar is a simple crunchy combination of delicious smooth milk chocolate and crispy cereal pieces. In the UK market consumers can also enjoy CRUNCH® in a white chocolate 31g bar, a milk chocolate 33g bar, a milk chocolate and hazelnut 100g sharing block and a milk chocolate 120g sharing block.

Each ROLO® tube is made from paper and aluminium foil, which can be easily recycled in the UK. Initially produced at the Mackintosh factory in Norwich, in 1994 production was transferred to Nestle's Fawdon factory in Newcastle, UK, where they still continue to be made to this day in their billions! ROLO® is most famously recalled for its strapline ""Do you love anyone enough to give them your last ROLO®?"" which has been used in the UK since 1980. ROLO® does not contain any artificial colours, flavour or preservatives. In the UK market consumers can enjoy ROLO® in 52g tube, 126g sharing bag and 280g minis packs, all of which can be found in retailers all year around. Additionally you can also enjoy ROLO® though a range of seasonal gifts including Easter Eggs and Christmas giant tube.Nutritional Compass ® ® Reg.

YORKIE set out to be a chunky alternative to other rival chocolate bars and was advertised as the bar of choice of the long distance lorry driver in it TV advertisement with the caption ""YORKIE - chunky milk chocolate"". YORKIE advertising continued the association with motoring through the 1970's and 1980's and other later tongue-in-cheek campaigns have consistently positioned it as the man's chocolate brand. YORKIE does not contain any artificial colours, flavours or preservatives.Number of uses/Servings: 3Contains 3 servings", £10.99, 16 x 138g , 20%,Yes,SAVE £3.40

TOFFEE CRISP is the crispy crunch, chewy munch that you simply can't resist! Originally created by Mackintosh's. TOFFEE CRISP were launched into the UK market in 1963. The idea for the TOFFEE CRISP bar originated from John Henderson, the great-nephew of John Mackintosh, who adapted a cake recipe made by his late wife Edith for their children. The recipe used a combination of crispy rice pieces and chocolate cake, however when he initially submitted samples to the board it was felt that it needed something more so after further development a soft toffee was added along the top and with its unique combination of textures with crispy cereal pieces, chewy toffee and smooth milk chocolate the TOFFEE CRISP was born. Initially TOFFEE CRISP Bars were produced at MacKintosh's factory in Halifax, however in 2012 production was moved to Newcastle where they still continue to be made to this day. In the 1980's and 1990's there were a series of TV advertisements which each ended with the strapline ""Somebody, somewhere is have a Toffee Crisp"".

You can see the white streaks, but you can't taste them, you can't feel them, you can't experience the true glorious marshmallowness of it all,” Ben remembers. Well, back in 1995, we suggested to the rock band Phish that we celebrate our shared Vermont, USA, roots by creating a Phish flavour. As the wheel started turning on the collaboration, Ben saw an opportunity to solve the marshmallow conundrum once and for all. Starting with a base of rich chocolate ice cream, he and our flavour gurus started bringing the band test tubs of the evolving concoction. “We ate many test tubs around the table with Phish. We’ve done flavours with other artists and entities, but nobody was more involved in creating the flavour than Phish was,” Jerry says. The band was instrumental, for example, in calling for caramel swirl, an addition that pushed the flavour over the top. We think Phish Food rocks. Enjoy!
